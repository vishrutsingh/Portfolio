I had a lot of knowledge but when i worked i found out i was very medicore at developing contracts. the hardest thing that i encountered was porting contracts form a different chain. It still is not easy as people might think. Leads me to think that if most blockchains work the same why not have a general configuration and generate based on a framework, but as i found out this is an extremely comlex problem. I still continue to consult people, but i am loosing interest in making genereal soulutions to these types of porblems."

It is a bit boring to try and learn things as you go because things repeat but in a different language or framework, but you can do what ever you want. Who knows where your idea might be used."
